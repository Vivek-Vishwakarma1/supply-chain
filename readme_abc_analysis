ABC Analysis is a method used in inventory management to categorize inventory items based on their importance. 
It divides inventory into three categories: A items, B items, and C items. A items are considered the most important and are given priority in terms of management 
attention and investment, while C items are considered the least important.

This analysis helps warehouse prioritize their inventory management efforts by focusing on items that have the greatest impact on the bottom line. 
A items typically represent a small percentage of total inventory items but generate a large percentage of total sales or consumption, 
while C items represent a large percentage of total inventory items but generate a small percentage of total sales or consumption.

The goal of ABC Analysis is to optimize inventory management by focusing resources on high-value items and reducing waste or inefficiencies on low-value items. 
This can result in reduced inventory costs, increased efficiency, and improved customer service.
